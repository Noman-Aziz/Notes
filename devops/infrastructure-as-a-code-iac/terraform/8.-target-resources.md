# 8. Target Resources

* We can target to deploy or delete individual resources in our config file.
* We can use the `-target` flag to specify the name of the resource
* E.g `terraform destory -target aws_instance.web-server-instance` is used to only destroy the ec2 instance from the whole deployment
