# 3. Delete Resources

* If we want to destroy the instance that we created, we can use the command `terraform destroy`
* Keep in mind that by default it destroys all the resources specified in the config file
* To delete a single resource, specific flags must be passed to the command
* In the previous example, if we want to delete the ec2 instance without using `terraform destroy` command, then, we will comment out the ec2 resource and re apply the config. Terraform will figure it out and delete the ec2 instance for us
