# 4. YAML Configuration File

### Introduction

* Config File is written in YAML Format
* Config File should be stored with the code inside SCM

***

### 3 Parts of K8 Config File

1. Metadata
2. Specification
3. Status (Auto Generated & Added by K8)
   * K8 Gets Status from etcd

***

### Template

* The specified **kind** has its own _metadata_ and _spec_
* Pod has also a section of its own which contains its own configuration&#x20;

#### Labels & Connectors

* _Metadata_ section contain the labels
* _Spec_ section contains the selectors

**Connecting Deployment to Pods**

* Deployment looks which pods belong to it using labels (key value pairs)
* The label is matched by the selector&#x20;

**Connecting Services to Deployments**

* Similar concept as connecting deployment to pods&#x20;

#### Ports in Service & Pods

* Service listens on port and forwards the request to target port which must be of a pod&#x20;
