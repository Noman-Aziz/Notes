### Release Management

* **Helm Version 2** comes in two parts
  1. Client (helm CLI)
  2. Server (Tiller)
     * Client sends request to Tiller
     * Tiller must be inside K8 Cluster
* Upon create or change deployment, tiller stores copy of configuration for future reference
* Keep tracks of all chart executions
* Changes are applied to existing deployment instead of creating new one
* Rollbacks are also handled
* Downsides
  * Tiller has too much power inside K8 i,e CRUD
  * Makes it a security issue
  * Tiller is removed in **Helm Version 3** which solves the security concern
