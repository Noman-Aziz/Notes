<summary>Cyber Security</summary>

Within the Cyber Security section, you'll find insights and materials covering a wide range of topics. These include Penetration Testing, where I've explored techniques for assessing the security of systems and networks, as well as Web Application Security, which covers best practices for securing web applications. Additionally, I've delved into other areas like Digital Forensics, Intrusion Detection, and more.



Most of these notes are derived from various courses, such as the **eLearnSecurity** eJPTv1 course and the **PortSwigger** Web Security course, as well as practical exercises and learning paths from platforms like **TryHackMe**.
