# Impacket's Psexec

PsExec is a portable tool from Microsoft that lets you run processes remotely using any user's credentials. It's a bit like a remote access program but instead of controlling the computer with a mouse, commands are sent via Command Prompt.

You can also use hashes (PASS THE HASH) instead of passwords to connect.
