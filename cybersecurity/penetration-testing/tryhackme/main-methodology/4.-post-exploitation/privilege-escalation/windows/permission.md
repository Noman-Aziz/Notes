# Permission

### **Windows Permission Viewer Command**

A tool you can use to check the files or folder permissions is "icacls".

#### Output Breakdown

* I - permission inherited from the parent container
* F - full access (full control)
* M - Modify right/access
* OI - object inherit
* IO - inherit only
* CI - container inherit
* RX - read and execute
* AD - append data (add subdirectories)
* WD - write data and add files

You can use icacls to check permissions, set ownership of the folder, set, remove or deny permissions. An example would be setting the ownership of the folder to Users.
