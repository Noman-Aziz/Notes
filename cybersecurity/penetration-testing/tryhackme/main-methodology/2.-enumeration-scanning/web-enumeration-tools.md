# Web Enumeration Tools

### **Dirb**

DIRB is a Web Content Scanner. It looks for existing (and/or hidden) Web Objects. It basically works by launching a dictionary based attack against a web server and analyzing the response.

DIRB comes with a set of preconfigured attack wordlists for easy usage but you can use your custom wordlists. Also DIRB sometimes can be used as a classic CGI scanner, but remember is a content scanner not a vulnerability scanner.

### **Gobuster**

it tries to find valid directories from a wordlist of possible directories. gobuster can also be used to valid subdomains using the same method.

***

### **Nikto**

It is commonly used to check for common CVE's such as shellshock, and to get general information about the web server that you're enumerating.

### **OWASP Zap Scanner**

OWASP ZAP (short for Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security scanner. When used as a proxy server it allows the user to manipulate all of the traffic that passes through it, including traffic using https.
