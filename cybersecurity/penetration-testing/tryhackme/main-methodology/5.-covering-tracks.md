# 5. Covering Tracks

Most professional/ethical penetration testers never have the need to "cover their tracks". However, this is still a phase in the methodology.

You should always have explicit permission from the system owner regarding when the test is happening, how its occurring, and the scope of targets in any penetration test.

Since the rules of engagement for a penetration test should be agreed to before the test occurs, the penetration tester should stop IMMEDIATELY when they have achieved privilege escalation and report the finding to the client.
