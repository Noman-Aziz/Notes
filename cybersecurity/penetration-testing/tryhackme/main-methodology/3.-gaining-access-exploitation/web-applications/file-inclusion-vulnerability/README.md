# File Inclusion Vulnerability

### **Introduction**

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is the vulnerability that is mostly found in web servers. This vulnerability is exploited when a user input contains a certain path to the file which might be present on the server and will be included in the output. This kind of vulnerability can be used to read files containing sensitive and confidential data from the vulnerable system.

#### Cause and Defense

The main cause of this type of Vulnerability is improper sanitization of the user's input. Sanitization here means that whatever user input should be checked and it should be made sure that only the expected values are passed and nothing suspicious is given in input. It is a type of Vulnerability commonly found in PHP based websites but isn't restricted to them.

### **Importance of Arbitrary file reading**

A lot of the time LFI can lead to accessing (without the proper permissions) important and classified data. An attacker can use LFI to read files from your system which can give away sensitive information such as passwords/SSH keys; enumerated data can be further used to compromise the system.

### **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**

RFI vulnerabilities are easier to exploit but less common. Instead of accessing a file on the local machine, the attacker is able to execute code hosted on their own machine.

When web applications take user input (URL, parameter value, etc.) and pass them into file include commands, the web application might be tricked into including remote files with malicious code.
