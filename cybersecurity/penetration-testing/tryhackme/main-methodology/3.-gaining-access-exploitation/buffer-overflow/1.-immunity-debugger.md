# 1. Immunity Debugger

**Always run Immunity Debugger as Administrator if you can.**

There are generally two ways to use Immunity Debugger to debug an application:

1. Make sure the application is running, open Immunity Debugger, and then use :code:`File -> Attach` to attack the debugger to the running process.
2. Open Immunity Debugger, and then use :code:`File -> Open` to run the application.

When attaching to an application or opening an application in Immunity Debugger, the application will be paused. Click the "Run" button or press F9.

Note: If the binary you are debugging is a Windows service, you may need to restart the application via `sc`

```bash
sc stop SLmail
sc start SLmail
```

Some applications are configured to be started from the service manager and will not work unless started by service control.
