# 7. Find a Jump Point

The mona jmp command can be used to search for jmp (or equivalent) instructions to a specific register. The jmp command will, by default, ignore any modules that are marked as aslr or rebase.

The following example searches for "jmp esp" or equivalent (e.g. call esp, push esp; retn, etc.) while ensuring that the address of the instruction doesn't contain the bad chars \x00, \x0a, and \x0d.

```
!mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00\x0a\x0d"
```

The mona find command can similarly be used to find specific instructions, though for the most part, the jmp command is sufficient:

```
!mona find -s 'jmp esp' -type instr -cm aslr=false,rebase=false,nx=false -cpb "\x00\x0a\x0d"
```

Choose an address from the log window and update your exploit.py script, setting the `retn` variable to the address, written backwards (if the system is little endian). For example if the address is `\x01\x02\x03\x04` in Immunity, write it as `\x04\x03\x02\x01` in your exploit.
