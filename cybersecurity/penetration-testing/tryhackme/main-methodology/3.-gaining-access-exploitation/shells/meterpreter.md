# Meterpreter

On the subject of Metasploit, another important thing to discuss is a Meterpreter shell. Meterpreter shells are Metasploit's own brand of fully-featured shell.

They are completely stable, making them a very good thing when working with Windows targets. They also have a lot of inbuilt functionality of their own, such as file uploads and downloads.

If we want to use any of Metasploit's post-exploitation tools then we need to use a meterpreter shell.

The downside to meterpreter shells is that they must be caught in Metasploit. They are also banned from certain certification examinations, so it's a good idea to learn alternative methodologies.
