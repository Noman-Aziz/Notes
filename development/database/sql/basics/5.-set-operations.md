# 5. Set Operations

### Union

**(**_**combine result sets of multiple queries into a single result set.**_**)**

*

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* Combines result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set
* The queries must conform to the following rules:
  * The number and order of columns in the select list of both queries must be same
  * The data types must be compatible
* It also removes all the duplicate rows from the combined data set
  * To retain the duplicate rows, you should use the `UNION ALL` instead

#### UNION with ORDER BY clause

* `UNION` operator may place the rows from the result ret of the first query before or after or between the rows from the result set of the second query
* To sort the rows in the final result set, you use the `ORDER BY` caluse in the second query
  * If you place the ORDER BY clause at the end of each query, the combined result set will not be sorted as you expected.

#### Examples

We have a table `top_rated_films`

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We have a table `most_popular_films`

**1. Combine data from both tables**

```sql
SELECT * from top_rated_films
UNION
SELECT * from most_popular_films;
```

**2. Combine result sets from both tables including duplicates**

```sql
SELECT * from top_rated_films
UNION ALL
SELECT * from most_popular_films;
```

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (59).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**3. Combine result sets from both tables including duplicates and ordering them**

```sql
SELECT * from top_rated_films
UNION ALL
SELECT * from most_popular_films
ORDER BY title;
```

### Intersect

**(**_**combine the result sets of two or more queries and returns a single result set that has the rows appear in both result sets.**_**)**

*

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* This operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set
* It returns any rows that are available in both result sets.

#### PostgreSQL INTERSECT with ORDER BY clause

* If you want to sort the result set returned by the `INTERSECT` operator, you place the `ORDER BY` at the final query in the query list like in the `UNION` operator

#### Example (Get popular films which are also top rated films)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM most_popular_films
INTERSECT
SELECT *
FROM top_rated_films;
```

### Except

**(**_**return the rows in the first query that does not appear in the output of the second query.**_**)**

*

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* The `EXCEPT` operator returns distinct rows from the first (left) query that are not in the output of the second (right) query.
* The queries need to follow these rules
  * The number of columns and their orders must be same in two queries
  * The data types of respective columns must be compatible

#### Example (Find top-rated films that are not popular)

```sql
SELECT * FROM top_rated_films
EXCEPT
SELECT * FROM most_popular_films
ORDER BY title;
```
