# 1. Introduction

### The Oracle Problem

* Blockchains can't interact with real world data and events

#### Oracles

* Any device that interacts with off chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts
* We need decentralized oracle network

***

### Smart Contracts

An agreement, contract or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain.

A smart contract is

* Cannot be altered (**immutable**)
* Automatically executes
* Everyone sees terms of agreement

#### Hybrid Smart Contracts

* Combining off chain decentralized logic with off chain decentralized data and decentralized computation gives rise to hybrid smart contracts

***

### Chainlink

* It is a decentralized oracle network

***

### Versions of Web

#### Web1

The permissionless open sourced web with static content

#### Web2

The permissioned web, with dynamic content. Where companies run your agreements on their servers

#### Web3

The permissionless web with dynamic content. Where decentralized censorship resistant networks run your agreement and code.

* Stands for Decentralized Finance

#### DAOs

* Stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

#### NFTs
