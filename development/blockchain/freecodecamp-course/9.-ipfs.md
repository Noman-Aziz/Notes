# 9. IPFS

### IPFS

* P2P data storage
* It takes Hash of data uploaded and use it as a link
* Our node pins the hash with the data
* All other nodes only have hash of the data, not the data itself
* Other nodes will have to pin our data in order to replicate the data



### Hosting Site on IPFS

#### Method 1 (Manual)

1. Download IPFS Desktop application to create your own node
2. Install IPFS Companion browser application
3. Upload **static website** files to our node and pin it

#### Method 2 (Automatic / [Fleek.co](https://fleek.co))

* We can use its service to auto deploy static websites
* It also helps other nodes to pin our files
  * Uses **filecoin blockchain** to pin our data on other nodes for persistence
* Also gives us http-url along with ipfs-hash
